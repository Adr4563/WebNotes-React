# Development environment

First, create the development environment:
```
# Reinstall React dependencies modules
npm install vite --save-dev
# or
yarn add vite --dev
```

# WebNotes_React
In this brief development, a simple note taking application has been created. This application will allow the user to create, view, edit, and delete notes. To achieve this, we will utilize programming tools that provide structure and design in the application. These include **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** within the React template.

# More information 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
